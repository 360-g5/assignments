## Assignment 2: Interactive Driving Simulation

#### Generate core track
- Sho Okano

#### Camera & driving controls
- William created a simple camera input for a first person camera driving experience. Current implementation only moves camera and rotates it using wasd controls. To setup, create node3d, attach main.gd as script, create a child of node3d with a camera3d, attach script. Then setup input handling, instructions in cameraController.gd
- William created CharacterBody3d with camera attached and reworked movement to add collision to the player, terrain, and track.
