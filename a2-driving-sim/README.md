## Assignment 2: Interactive Driving Simulation

#### Generate core track
- Sho Okano
- Aniket Sandhu 

#### Camera & driving controls
- William created a simple camera input for a first person camera driving experience. Current implementation only moves camera and rotates it using wasd controls. To setup, create node3d, attach main.gd as script, create a child of node3d with a camera3d, attach script. Then setup input handling, instructions in cameraController.gd https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpU0qGcv1iY
- William created CharacterBody3d with camera attached and reworked movement to add collision to the player, terrain, and track. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Aa7mAwrTRg

#### Weather particles: 
- William added smoke/exhaust particles using the particle system, attaching a smoke texture. The smoke trail follows the camera, so driving along, the user will see their path.
