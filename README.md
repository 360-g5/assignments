- Aniket Sandhu,
  The terrain looked blocky because each triangle was created with its own vertices, so lighting couldnâ€™t blend across them.  

I fixed this by:
- Adding `st.index()` so vertices are shared between triangles.
- Using `st.generate_normals()` so normals are averaged for smooth shading.
